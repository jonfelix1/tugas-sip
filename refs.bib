abstract = {Core banking system (CBS) is an information system which provides basic functionalities such as banking transactions for banks, and is often considered the heart of the banks. Today CBS is recognized as having a key role in creating competitive edges for the banking industry. Now CBS has been more widely adopted by banks in Vietnam. It is still unclear, however, that the staff members of the banks, as the primary internal users of CBS, see this system. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine the factors that may have effect on user satisfaction toward CBS in the Vietnamese banking industry by applying information system (IS) success model. By surveying the staff members who work for Techcombank and have experiences in using CBS in Vietnam, this study collects data for empirical validation. The results show that all the three main constructs in the IS success model; i.e., information quality, system quality, and service quality, have positive and significant effect on user satisfaction toward CBS, indicating the applicability of the IS success model to the CBS use behavior in Vietnam. Comparatively, service quality has the strongest effect on user satisfaction, while information quality has the weakest. It is thus suggested that banks in Vietnam make more effort to improve the service quality of CBS by improving its dependability and promptness, and by keeping CBS up with the up-to-date hardware and software.},

    abstract = { Switching barriers help telecom service providers create intangible restriction before telecom subscribers preventing them from switching to other service providers. This study aims at ranking the switching barriers to identify critical success factors of telecom service providers to retain customers and attain a competitive advantage in the market. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used as a tool to rank the identified switching barriers. The literature review helped in identifying eight crucial switching barriers which were ranked using the AHP method. A pair-wise comparison is made to obtain opinions from 32 experts and consultants in the field of telecom service provider industry to conduct AHP analysis. The AHP is analysed by pair-wise comparisons generated from expert opinions. The research findings helped in understanding the different priorities and corresponding weights of switching barriers which were eventually ranked based on the weights. This study enables the telecom service providers to adopt suitable strategies based on the ranking. This will help telecom service providers retain customers and thereby gain a competitive advantage. }
