abstract = {This paper extends hierarchical analysis to the case where the participants are allowed to employ fuzzy ratios in place of exact ratios. If a person considers alternative A more important than alternative B, then the ratio used might be approximately 3 to 1, or between 2 to 1, and 4 to 1, or at most 5 to 1. The pairwise comparison of the issues and the criteria in the hierarchy produce fuzzy positive reciprocal matrices. The geometric mean method is employed to calculate the fuzzy weights for each fuzzy matrix, and these are combined in the usual manner to determine the final fuzzy weights for the alternatives. The final fuzzy weights are used to rank the alternatives from highest to lowest. The highest ranking contains all the undominated issues. The procedure easily extends to the situation where many experts are utilized in the ranking process, or to the case of missing data. Two examples are presented showing the final fuzzy weights and the final ranking.}

abstract = {In this paper, a new approach for handling fuzzy AHP is introduced, with the use of triangular fuzzy numbers for pairwise comprison scale of fuzzy AHP, and the use of the extent analysis method for the synthetic extent value Si of the pairwise comparison. By applying the principle of the comparison of fuzzy numbers, that is, V(M1 ⩾ M2) = 1 iff m1 ⩾ m2, V(M2 ⩾ M1) = hgt(M1 ∩ M2) = μM1 (d), the vectors of weight with respect to each element under a certaine criterion are represented by d(Ai) = min V(Si ⩾ Sk), k = 1, 2,…, n; k ≠ i. This decision process is demonstrated by an example.}

abstract = {Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a broadly applied multi-criteria decision-making method to determine the weights of criteria and priorities of alternatives in a structured manner based on pairwise comparison. As subjective judgments during comparison might be imprecise, fuzzy sets have been combined with AHP. This is referred to as fuzzy AHP or FAHP. An increasing amount of papers are published which describe different ways to derive the weights/priorities from a fuzzy comparison matrix, but seldomly set out the relative benefits of each approach so that the choice of the approach seems arbitrary. A review of various fuzzy AHP techniques is required to guide both academic and industrial experts to choose suitable techniques for a specific practical context. This paper reviews the literature published since 2008 where fuzzy AHP is applied to decision-making problems in industry, particularly the various selection problems. The techniques are categorised by the four aspects of developing a fuzzy AHP model: (i) representation of the relative importance for pairwise comparison, (ii) aggregation of fuzzy sets for group decisions and weights/priorities, (iii) defuzzification of a fuzzy set to a crisp value for final comparison, and (iv) consistency measurement of the judgements. These techniques are discussed in terms of their underlying principles, origins, strengths and weakness. Summary tables and specification charts are provided to guide the selection of suitable techniques. Tips for building a fuzzy AHP model are also included and six open questions are posed for future work.}

abstract = {Core banking system (CBS) is an information system which provides basic functionalities such as banking transactions for banks, and is often considered the heart of the banks. Today CBS is recognized as having a key role in creating competitive edges for the banking industry. Now CBS has been more widely adopted by banks in Vietnam. It is still unclear, however, that the staff members of the banks, as the primary internal users of CBS, see this system. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to examine the factors that may have effect on user satisfaction toward CBS in the Vietnamese banking industry by applying information system (IS) success model. By surveying the staff members who work for Techcombank and have experiences in using CBS in Vietnam, this study collects data for empirical validation. The results show that all the three main constructs in the IS success model; i.e., information quality, system quality, and service quality, have positive and significant effect on user satisfaction toward CBS, indicating the applicability of the IS success model to the CBS use behavior in Vietnam. Comparatively, service quality has the strongest effect on user satisfaction, while information quality has the weakest. It is thus suggested that banks in Vietnam make more effort to improve the service quality of CBS by improving its dependability and promptness, and by keeping CBS up with the up-to-date hardware and software.},

    abstract = { Switching barriers help telecom service providers create intangible restriction before telecom subscribers preventing them from switching to other service providers. This study aims at ranking the switching barriers to identify critical success factors of telecom service providers to retain customers and attain a competitive advantage in the market. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used as a tool to rank the identified switching barriers. The literature review helped in identifying eight crucial switching barriers which were ranked using the AHP method. A pair-wise comparison is made to obtain opinions from 32 experts and consultants in the field of telecom service provider industry to conduct AHP analysis. The AHP is analysed by pair-wise comparisons generated from expert opinions. The research findings helped in understanding the different priorities and corresponding weights of switching barriers which were eventually ranked based on the weights. This study enables the telecom service providers to adopt suitable strategies based on the ranking. This will help telecom service providers retain customers and thereby gain a competitive advantage. }
